UO CIT 281 - Project 6

# Project:
Project 6 allowed us to be creative and create a program of our choice. The goal was to use AI to help link the server to a client, allowing the program to be run in a browser in a web browser. My project was a simple to-do list. The user has the ability to add, modify, and delete items on the to-do list which is displayed on the webpage. The list updates dynamically based on the operation they perform. I tested this first in the console and then connected it to a webpage and stylesheet. AI was used to create the HTML and CSS files. AI was used minimally for the server to help decide what the different route names should be.

# Lab: 
In Lab 7, our primary goal is to create a GitHub personal website within a repository.Content is added to this repository and changes are pushed to GitHub - this was done in VS Code. Within this repository, a JavaScript file named `lab-07.js` is created, and the folder is initialized using npm. The lab also involves practicing error handling by updating `lab-07.js` to include custom error handling. This lab emphasizes the use of GitHub for version control, the creation of a personal website, and the practice of error handling in JavaScript.
