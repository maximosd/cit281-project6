    <p class="projectDescription">
        Project 6 allowed us to be creative and create a program of our choice. The goal was to use AI
        to help link the server to a client, allowing the program to be run in a browser in a web browser. My 
        project was a simple to-do list. The user has the ability to add, modify, and delete items on the 
        to-do list which is displayed on the webpage. The list updates dynamically based on the operation they 
        perform. I tested this first in the console and then connected it to a webpage and stylesheet. AI was
        used to create the HTML and CSS files. AI was used minimally for the server to
        help decide what the different route names should be.

    <p class="labDescriptions">
        In Lab 7, our primary goal is to create a GitHub personal website within a repository.Content is added to this 
        repository and changes are pushed to GitHub - this was done in VS Code. Within this repository, a JavaScript file 
        named `lab-07.js` is created, and the folder is initialized using npm. The lab also involves 
        practicing error handling by updating `lab-07.js` to include custom error handling. 
        This lab emphasizes the use of GitHub for version control, the creation of a personal website, and 
        the practice of error handling in JavaScript.
